# Hexit Strategy Game

Hexit Strategy is a fun labrynth puzzle where the player makes their own path. At the start of each level, there is no way through. You must rotate the walls of the hexagonal rooms to move through the level. When in any room, you can rotate that room but a selection of other rooms will also rotate.
